  IMPORTANT: .chezmoiignore matches against a file's FINAL DESTINATION PATH,
  not its source path in the repository.

  For example, the source file:
    `private_dot_config/age/secret_key.txt.age-symmetric`
  has a destination (target) path of:
    `.config/age/secret_key.txt.age-symmetric`
  Therefore, the destination path is what must be used in this file.

#
# How .chezmoiignore Works
#
# This file tells chezmoi which files or directories to ignore. It prevents
# chezmoi from prompting you to add them to your managed dotfiles.
#
# The patterns in this file are matched against a file's TARGET PATH (its
# final destination in your home directory, relative to ~).
#
# --- Pattern Matching Rules & Examples ---
#
# 1. To ignore a specific file at an exact, nested path (MOST EXPLICIT & RECOMMENDED):
#    # This ignores `~/.config/brewfile/brew_last_run` but not `~/brew_last_run`.
#    .config/brewfile/brew_last_run
#
# 2. To ignore ANY file with a specific name, no matter how deeply nested (POWERFUL):
#    # The `**` is a "globstar" that matches any number of directories.
#    # This ignores `foo/some_cache.db`, `bar/baz/some_cache.db`, etc.
#    **/some_cache.db
#
# 3. To ignore an entire directory and all of its contents:
#    # This ignores the `~/.npm` directory and everything inside it.
#    .npm/
#
# 4. To ignore a file ONLY at the root of your home directory:
#    # This ignores `~/a_root_file`, but NOT `~/.config/a_root_file`.
#    a_root_file
#
