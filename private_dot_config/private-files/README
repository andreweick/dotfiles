# Private Files Directory

This directory contains decrypted sensitive files like:
- Licensed fonts (.otf, .ttf)
- Software licenses
- Installation scripts with embedded licenses
- Other sensitive materials that need encryption at rest

## How it works:
- Source files are stored encrypted (.age) in the chezmoi repository
- During 'chezmoi apply', files automatically decrypt here if age key exists
- Directory is created with 0700 permissions (owner-only access)
- If no age key is available, this directory won't be created

## Directory structure:
- fonts/     - Licensed font files
- licenses/  - License files and installation scripts
- (add more subdirectories as needed)

## Security:
- This directory should NEVER be added to git
- Original files are encrypted in the chezmoi source
- Manual installation/usage from here is your responsibility
