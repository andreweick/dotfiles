# This helper script encrypts your master age private key in two ways:
#   1. Encrypted to ALL SSH public keys found in ~/.ssh.
#   2. Encrypted with a symmetric master password.
#
# It assumes the unencrypted key is located at ~/.config/age/key.txt.
# It will check if the encrypted keys already exist and ask before overwriting.
