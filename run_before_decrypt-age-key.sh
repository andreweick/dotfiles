# This script bootstraps the entire chezmoi decryption process.
# It checks for a master key in the CHEZMOI_MASTER_KEY or AGE_PASSWORD
# environment variables. If found, it uses that key to symmetrically decrypt
# the primary age private key.
# It only produces output when run in an interactive terminal, unless an error occurs.

# --- Configuration ---
# The final destination for your decrypted age private key.
# This MUST match the `identity` path in your chezmoi.toml.
KEY_DESTINATION="${HOME}/.config/age/key.txt"

# The path to your *symmetrically encrypted* age key within your chezmoi source repo.
# Update this to match where you added the file in Step 2.
