# This script bootstraps the entire chezmoi decryption process.
# It checks for a master key in the CHEZMOI_MASTER_KEY or AGE_PASSWORD
# environment variables. If found, it uses that key to symmetrically decrypt
# the primary age private key.
# It only produces output when run in an interactive terminal, unless an error occurs.
